# HipHopf
DirectX D3D11 rendering of the Hopf Fibration. 

This is a Windows 10 UWP project built with Visual Studio 2017. For a more responsive graphics experience, please build for x64 Release rather than debug. 

This Visual Studio solution has two external dependencies, namely Microsoft DirectXTK and DirectXMesh, both of which are freely available on github. 

Rendering the Hopf Fibration demands some deep mathematical results, most of which I attribute to Niles Johnson (also on github) and the excellent paper "An Elementary Introduction to the Hopf Fibration" by David W. Lyons.
